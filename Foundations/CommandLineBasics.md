# Command Line Basics

[Command Line Basics](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)

The shell is a **CLI**, a Command Line Interface, and a scripting language

- A shell is a program whose primary purpose is to read commands and run other programs.

- This lesson uses Bash, the default shell in many implementations of Unix.

- Programs can be run in Bash by entering commands at the command-line prompt.

- The shell’s main advantages are its high action-to-keystroke ratio, its support for automating repetitive tasks, and its capacity to access networked machines.

- The shell’s main disadvantages are its primarily textual nature and how cryptic its commands and operation can be.

- bin directory: build-in programs are stored
- Users directory: users' personal directories are stored
- tmp for temporary files
